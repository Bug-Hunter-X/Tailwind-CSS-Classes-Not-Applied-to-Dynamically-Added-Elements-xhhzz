# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applied to Dynamically Added Elements

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Tailwind CSS with frameworks like Next.js or Nuxt.js that employ CSS-in-JS: Tailwind classes failing to apply to elements added to the DOM after the initial Tailwind processing.

## Problem

Dynamically rendered elements, often added through state changes or asynchronous operations, may not receive the expected Tailwind styles. This is because the styling is applied during the initial rendering, and subsequent DOM updates don't trigger a re-application of Tailwind classes.

## Solution

The solution involves using techniques that force Tailwind to re-process the styles after the dynamic elements have been added to the DOM.  This typically involves using a framework-specific solution, such as `useInsertionEffect` (in React) to ensure the Tailwind classes are applied.
