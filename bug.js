This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js that uses a CSS-in-JS solution. The issue arises when you try to apply Tailwind classes to an element that is rendered *after* the Tailwind directives have been processed. This often happens with dynamically added elements or components.

```javascript
//Example in a Next.js Component
function MyComponent() {
  const [showElement, setShowElement] = useState(false);

  const handleClick = () => setShowElement(true);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Show Element</button>
      {showElement && <div className="bg-red-500 p-4">Dynamically added element</div>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

The `div` with the Tailwind classes might not be styled correctly because it's added to the DOM after Tailwind has done its initial processing.
